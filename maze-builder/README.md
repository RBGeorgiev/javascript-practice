# Maze builder in javascript

You can see it in action here: https://snc0u.csb.app/

This is a visualization of popular maze building algorithms. The algorithms create perfect mazes, which means there is only one path through the maze and any 2 random points in the maze have a path connecting them. I created the maze builder as a small add-on to use with my pathfinding visualization project, but ended up expanding on it a lot more than I had originally planned.
