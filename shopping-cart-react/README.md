A simple mock-up of an online clothes shop with a floating shopping cart. Made using React & React-Redux with the help of React-Bootstrap. 

This project was practice working with React, as well a learning experience on using Redux and Bootstrap with React. The aim was to build a mock-up/prototype ecommerce application with instant visual updates and scaleable code with a focus on a friendly user experience.

### Features

* Responsive design
* Products persist in floating cart after page reloads
